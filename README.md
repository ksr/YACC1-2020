# YACC1-2020

Finally time to try building a custom CPU from basic TTL and other "simple" ICs (no 74ls181 ALU, that would be cheating :-) ) 
-- Thanks for taking a look --

The One Page Computer Project, provides the tools and resources to learn computer science starting from the basics of digital logic through to a fully working custom CPU with a user defined instruction set, assembler, BASIC interpreter, and one day an operating system with standard tools.

The project is currently under development as a personal project. The basic idea has kicking around inside my head for years (47 years to be exact), but until recently never made it to the top of my list. Now I am exploring if this project might be interesting to others, perhaps as an educational tool or maybe just a fun project. Files can be found at https://github.com/ksr/YACC1-2020

I am interested in speaking with:
High school computer science educators
Freshman and sophomore college computer science educators
Electronics enthusiasts

## Directories

### Data Sheets:
		Useful data sheets, manuals, references.
			(These are all readily available online but if I inadvertently violated copyright please let me know and I will remove immediately)

### General Notes:
		System wide notes, more specific notes in various subdirectories
		
### PCB:
		PCB designs, there are two different subdirectories:
			Production: These are the latest fully functioning designs, most likely currently in use
			Working - Underdevelopment: These are the newest versions of the boards in design
			
### Photos & Videos:
		Some sharable files

### Presentations:
		Presentations related to the YACC1-2020 project
		
### Software:
		All software related to the project, see subdirectory for more information
		
### Utilities:
		Arduino: Configuration files for Arduino code
		Clocker: External Arduino based to tool for single step debug operations
		Eagle: Configuration files for Eagle
		Waveforms: Timing diagrams for cpu instructions, probably should move to software area
